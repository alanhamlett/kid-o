**** NOTES for Kid-O App *****
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Project Description and Goals:

Children's aid projects often struggle with maintaining a clear overview of the children who are part of these projects. This is a day to day issue which hinders the work of aid workers and can lead to the lack of addressing a child's special needs. Kid-O solves this challenge by creating a children's profile management system. Aid workers can now get a clear overview of each child's basic info in the overview page and get a more detailed view on the child's profile page. Information such as the child's name, age, guardian's name, their current situation at home and school, their home location visualized in a map are shown in this detailed view. Aid workers can create new profiles, edit old profiles and see in the overview which information of the child is missing. Furthermore, they can even add new children profiles through textmessaging, so that the lack of internet does not Keeping the children's information uptodate and accessible for the aid workers can facilitate and improve the aid workers efficiency in the project and make sure that no child is left behind.

PostgreSQL: Use Array for sibling ids? Look up each sibling through child table: If not in table, just show as string?
