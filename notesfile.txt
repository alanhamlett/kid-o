**** NOTES for Kid-O App *****
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Project Description and Goals:

Children's aid projects often struggle with maintaining a clear overview of the children who are part of the project. This problem is foremost apparent when briefing new incoming volunteers which occures every 3-6 months. An app that gives a clear overview of the chidlren, including a photo and additional information such as their current situation, name of their guardian, location of their home etc. would ease the volunteers work and make it more efficient.
